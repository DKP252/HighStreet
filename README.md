# Abstract 
## Bringing DEFI concepts to Products  
### Inspiration 
On May 9th 2019, the Uniswap team announced Unisocks($SOCKS) at the Fluidity Summit in NYC. Although Unisocks wouldn't be the first product represented on the Ethereum blockchain by Tokens, it would be the first to allow every token to be redeemable for a pair of actual SOCKS in real life. Since only 500 tokens will ever exist, every SOCKS sold increases the price of the next. Following a bonding curve to govern it's price, Unisocks tokens can be sold back to the liquidity pool at any time.

### Marketplace for Limited Edition Products
Although Unisocks was launched as a proof of concept for a decentralized exchange, it demonstrated a viable path to disrupting the way physical goods are released. From a Luxury Brand's new line of fashion to Concert Tickets, Fine Dining Restaurant Reservation to Small Batch Wine and Whisky sales, any limited edition product can be sold on a bonding curve. As such, our team has taken upon ourselves to build exactly that, a marketplace for high end brands to launch their limited edition products. 

# Market Maker and Price Discovery of Products 
## Why Would Brands Want This? 
Secondary market of limited edition assets had always been difficult for tier 1 brands to handle. Forgery and Fraud is rampent and the logistics of aftermarket product transfer always required a little too much faith between transacting users. Using a token based system of trading solves this problem by removing the asset completely during transactions. Buyers who are interested in Alt Assets for the lucrative returns only have to deal with buying and selling token on the exchanges, while real collectors can redeem their tokens with full confidence that the product is coming directly from brand.

# Staking Yield and Token Utilities 

## Membership
Membership is a right earned by staking our platform token. Platform token holders will be given the right to not only buy product tokens but also being able to vote later on new shops and brands being onboarded as well as priority of new product listings. 

## Staking Yield 
Staking incentives are our way of creating monetary and governance incentives for our most commited members. Based on our staking and reward projections. Liquidity providers for our platform token will have product tokens allocated to them everytime a new product is dropped. A portion of platform tokens are also reserved for early stakers, this incentivize stakers to hold their tokens while the market is maturing and new brands and shops are being added. Staking rewards will decrease as platform becomes self sustaining. 

## Governance 
Owning platform token enable users to participate in the governance process through a decentralized organization, with proposals and voting structures. They are also able to vote on issues related to operations and how to streamline and onboard future products.

# Tech Breakdown 
## Backend: Ethereum/Solidity 
Smart contract written in Solidity using Hardhat Framework will govern every peer to peer user interaction. All builds will be tested using Ganache and peer reviewed. 

## Frontend: Web and VR
The DAO interface will be a web application built on React and wrapped with web3JS. Buying, Trading, and Redemption of tokens can be performed on the web app interface. Redeeming a product token will send it to address 0, effectively burning it and removing it from circulation forever.

The virutal market extension built in Unity is also fully accessible on PC and Stand Alone VR platforms. It act as a a completely interactive metaverse for user to buy, trade, and redeem tokens in a more social enviornment. Every brand and product along with their associated token can be bought at Virtual Shops. Bigger brands will have more custom user experiences built into their stores depending on their partnership with us. All user tokens will be represented as interactive 3D objects once logged into our Virtual Market. We are working to include support for external tokens as well, for example a user with cryptokitties in their metamask wallet will have their PNG file converted to a completely rigged and animated 3D model.

## Features
We believe the future home of digital assets will most certainly be in Virtual Reality. We are building the shopping component of the shared metaverse.
