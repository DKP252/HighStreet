# Staking Yield and Token Utilities 

##Membership
Membership is a right earned by staking our platform token. Platform token holders will be given the right to not only buy product tokens but also being able to vote later on new shops and brands being onboarded as well as priority of new product listings. 

## Staking Yield 
Staking incentives are our way of creating monetary and governance incentives for our most commited members. Based on our staking and reward projections. Liquidity providers for our platform token will have product tokens allocated to them everytime a new product is dropped. A portion of platform tokens are also reserved for early stakers, this incentivize stakers to hold their tokens while the market is maturing and new brands and shops are being added. Staking rewards will decrease as platform becomes self sustaining. 

##Governance 
Owning platform token enable users to participate in the governance process through a decentralized organization, with proposals and voting structures. They are also able to vote on issues related to operations and how to streamline and onboard future products. 


#Tech Breakdown 
##Backend: Ethereum/Solidity 
Smart contract written in Solidity using Hardhat Framework will govern every peer to peer user interaction. All builds will be tested using Ganache and peer reviewed. 

##Frontend: Web and VR
The DAO interface will be a web application built on React and wrapped with web3JS. Buying, Trading, and Redemption of tokens can be performed on the web app interface. Redeeming a product token will send it to address 0, effectively burning it and removing it from circulation forever. 

The virutal market extension built in Unity is also fully accessible on PC and Stand Alone VR platforms. It act as a a completely interactive metaverse for user to buy, trade, and redeem tokens in a more social enviornment. Every brand and product along with their associated token can be bought at Virtual Shops. Bigger brands will have more custom user experiences built into their stores depending on their partnership with us. All user tokens will be represented as interactive 3D objects once logged into our Virtual Market. We are working to include support for external tokens as well, for example a user with cryptokitties in their metamask wallet will have their PNG file converted to a completely rigged and animated 3D model. 

We believe the future home of digital assets will most certainly be in Virtual Reality. We are building the shopping component of the shared metaverse.
